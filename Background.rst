Transformation is the process by which foreign DNA is introduced into a cell. Bacterial cells are commonly used as host cells for making copies of plasmid DNA in the lab because they are quick and easy to grow.

Bacteria, especially *E.coli*, are the workhorse of a molecular lab. They are versatile organisms that can take in DNA and replicate it. 

The bacterial genome is a circular piece of DNA that, unlike eukaryotic DNA, is not contained within a nucleus. Bacteria can also take in small circles of DNA, call plasmids.

What is plasmid DNA?
********************

A plasmid is a double-stranded circular piece of DNA that is separate from the chromosomal DNA of the cell (Figure 1). It replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA.

Plasmids are used in molecular laboratories when studying or manipulating genes, using specifically engineered plasmids, commonly referred to as vectors.

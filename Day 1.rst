*****************************************
Make Luria broth (LB) and LB agar plates.
*****************************************

LB is a nutrient-rich media that is commonly used to grow bacteria. The addition of agar to LB results in the formation of a gel that bacteria can grow on, as they are unable to digest the agar but can gather nutrition from the LB within. You can also add an antibiotic to the broth. The antibiotic allows for the selection of only those bacteria with the specific antibiotic resistance that is conferred by a plasmid carrying the antibiotic resistance gene.

The following protocols require the use of LB and LB agar plates, both with and without antibiotic selection. You will need to make batches of each. They can be stored in airtight containers or wrapped in plastic bags, at 4Â°C for up to 2 weeks.

    1. Weigh out the following reagents each into a 1L Erlenmeyer flask (Table 1). Make a 500 mL batch of LB and a 1L batch of LB; you will add antibiotic to one batch at a later stage (see below).

**Table 1** Reagents for making LB and LB agar plates

   * - LB
     - LB agar plates
     - LB agar plates+antibiotic
   * - 5g NaCl
     - 5g NaCl
     - 5g NaCl
   * - 5g tryptone
     - 5g tryptone
     - 5g tryptone

*Do not add the antibiotic until after autoclaving and cooling to 55 degrees Celsius.

    2. Place magnetic stirrer into the bottom of the flasks and stir to mix.

.. note:: The contents do not have to be completely in solution, but any powder left on the sides of the flask will caramelize on the glass during autoclaving.

    3. Cover the top of the flasks with aluminum foil and label with autoclave tape.

    4. Autoclave on the liquid setting for 20 minutes or according to your autoclave's specifications.

    5. After removing the solution from the autoclave, allow the LB agar solution to cool to 55 degrees Celsius.

.. note:: This can be done by placing the flask in a 55 degree Celsius oven or water bath because this will hold the temperature and it can be left unattended for some time.

.. note:: The LB can cool to room temperature on the bench top. 

    6. Add the appropriate amount of the desired antibiotic to one flask of LB and one flask of LB + agar. The other two flasks (containing LB and LB + agar) will not contain any antibiotic. Table 2 lists commonly used antibiotics. The table specifies what the concentration of the stock solution should be made at.
